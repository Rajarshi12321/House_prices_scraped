## Installation and Dependencies

These are some required packages for our program which are mentioned in the Requirements.txt file

- scrapy

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
  
      ```shell
      conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
      ```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (Optional)

     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```


## Working with the code
Before starting out with the program, I had checked the html of the website and how the json files were stored in the script tags. It was a good experience for me to collect data from these scripts and use xpaths.

(Optional) You can checkout the website html for better understanding of the program

I have commented most of the neccesary information in the House_princing.py in spiders folder.

Now to run the program :-

1. Activating the env
  
    ```shell
    conda activate <your-env-name> 
    ```

2. Going the main file by changing directory
    ```shell
    cd House_price
    ```

3. Running the file to scrape the data
   
   ```shell
    scrapy crawl House_pricing -o <filename>
    ```
  This filename is where your scraped data would be stored,the data can be stored in .csv , .json or other type of files according to what type you will choose


## Results
The results of the project : This project is able to scrape 27900 data with 70+ features

You can check out the scrapped data that I published on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajarshiroy0123/house-prices-in-india-2023)
